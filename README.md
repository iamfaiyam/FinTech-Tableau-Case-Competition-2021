## Summary of Results

• Children have a higher survival rate

• Oldest age group bracket (70 years to 80 years) has 100% survival rate

• Notable differences in survivability in passenger classes

• The effect is partially attributable to the predominant gender with these classes

• Survival rates increases for family sizes up to 4, possibly due to increases support

• Survival rates suffer a huge drop for family sizes greater than 4

• The effect of embarked location on survival rates is quite negligible

• However, when combined with passenger class and gender, there seems to be a more noticeable effect

• On average, we have discovered that Cherbourg has the highest classes of passengers on average with the highest survival rate

• We have concluded that 1st class males have a lower survival rate than third class females

• Our analysis indicates no significant correlation between the starting letter of a passenger's surname and their corresponding survival rate

• Results showcase that there is consistency and no notable patterns
